## Development Log
***

1. Initially, I planned to have seven option on my menu list. On my development process I eliminated two of the functions, which are Check if Items in Shopping List and Total Items on Shopping List. The main reason for this is time constraint.
2. I encounter significant issue while implementing my user interface. I used curses library and took me almost three full days to have good understanding on how to implement it.
3. Lack of knowledge on the available package inside Ed editor. This took quite sometime to try and figure out each package purpose.
4. As I faced issue with curses, I change my development process by implementing the functionality first then only user interface. Generally, it should not be an issues. However, because I am using curses it has a unique way to print out string to the screen. Therefore, I need the additional time to rewrite it to make all text display properly.
5. After testing the application, The application executed as expected. One cosmetic error happened when I execute on Ed's terminal. At the beginning, The curses did not display the text as expected. After few navigation, it displayed as what I expected. I tried to find out what may cause this and still could not find the reason. There this is still on pending issue to be fix.
